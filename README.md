# Public Interest in Climate Change – Google Trends Analysis

## Overview

This project investigates public interest in climate change by analyzing Google Trends data and exploring the potential influence of media and social media on public perception. The analysis focuses on search trends for "climate change" and "Earth Day" over the past three years, exploring patterns and spikes in public attention.

## Project Summary

- Initial observation showed a consistent spike in Google searches for "climate change" around April each year, coinciding with Earth Day and Earth Month.
- The project explores the correlation between search interest and media coverage, emphasizing the potential role of social media in shaping public awareness.
- Additional research plans include analyzing social media posts on climate change for engagement and timing, as well as reviewing survey data from sources like the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Pew Research Center.
- The project discusses ethical considerations, especially concerning bias in surveys and the challenges of relying on social media data, which may not represent all demographics.
- A key theme identified is the rise of "doomism" — a sense of hopelessness about climate change — and the importance of countering it with accurate, optimistic messaging on social media to inspire action.

## Methods and Research Approaches

- Google Trends data analysis for search patterns over time.
- Planned social media content analysis focusing on timing, engagement, and sentiment.
- Review of existing surveys on public attitudes toward climate change.
- Proposed survey questions to fill gaps related to social media influence.

## Ethical Considerations

- Avoiding biased or leading questions in surveys.
- Ensuring diverse demographic representation to avoid misrepresenting public opinion.
- Being cautious about contributing to doomism and misinformation.
- Promoting accuracy and optimism in climate change communications.
